BASIL is depicted as a relatively shy boy, being rather insecure and fearing the thought of being perceived as a burden. He enjoys taking pictures, as his memories with his friends are his most treasured belonging, perceiving them as a way to permanently capture the moment. He also enjoys taking care of flowers, art, and reading. BASIL seems to develop strong emotional attachments to many of his possessions, as he will never throw away anything, no matter how worthless it is.
