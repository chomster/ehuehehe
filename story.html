Basil was born on February 18th to unnamed parents. He lived with his grandma since he was a toddler because his parents were "too busy". As a child, he was introduced to Kel, Hero, Mari, and Sunny by Aubrey and the group all became friends. Basil enjoyed taking photos, keeping a photo album with all his pictures, as well as gardening and reading.
</p>
<p>
On the day of the recital, Basil came to Sunny's house, only to witness Sunny becoming frustrated and throwing his violin from atop the stairs, causing it to break. When Sunny is confronted by Mari, he accidentally shoves her down the stairs and kills her. In complete shock, Basil helps him carry Mari up the stairs, and they lay her in bed. As Sunny panics and begins crying, Basil tries to comfort him and tell him that everything will be okay. After some time, they are forced to realize she is dead, her eyes open but unseeing. Basil, true composure obscured by Sunny's dissociating perspective, takes the lead in covering up the crime his best friend committed. They picked up Mari's body and lifted it down the staircase, carrying it out to the backyard.
</p>
<p>
They lay down Mari's body on the ground and the two of them hung her with a jump rope attached to a tree, as Sunny fixates blindly on surrounding leaves. Afterwards, he remains staring at her, swaying in the wind, but Basil clutches his hand and persists in walking them back into the house. Sunny looks up with cold realization as they go, while Basil's tired eyes silently shed tears, looking ahead. Suddenly, BASIL jerks to a stop, having looked back to see Mari's bulging eye staring at them through her hair. Sunny, following BASIL, also looks back, further traumatizing them both.

During the time skip, Basil is implied to have isolated himself as a shut-in, much like his best friend did, after that day. The earliest interaction he has after the time skip was when Aubrey initially noticed the photo album being covered in black marker and stole it, which is implied to have been days prior. Afterwards, it is presumed that Basil continued to keep the truth to himself while getting bullied by Aubrey and the Hooligans.
